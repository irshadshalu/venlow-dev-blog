### What Happened?

In the latest WhatsApp update (2.21.14.24), WhatsApp changed how video is shared and completely removed the ability to post high quality videos by users, which I think is a very bad move from WhatsApp since the default video quality is awful.

As a result, Venlow won't be useful to post HD statuses on WhatsApp anymore. I know many of you use Venlow regularly to improve the quality of stories that you share on WhatsApp. It is very unfortunate that they have made this decision. 

I want to thank each and every one of you for the generous feedback which motivated me to improve Venlow over time.

### So I can't use Venlow to post WhatsApp statuses anymore?

If you're on an older version of WhatsApp, then you can post videos without losing quality as it used to be. If you're on the recent versions of WhatsApp, it will work only for some very low values of the bitrate and resolution which again doesn't help with the quality.

### Can I still use Venlow?

Yes. We have made no changes to Venlow and Venlow will keep on working as it used to. It will produce output videos with original quality and reduced size. Here are some uses for Venlow

1. Share it to other apps which require a compressed video for good output (eg: Telegram)
2. Save the videos for saving storage - A 100 MB video can be stored at 12 MB and original video can be deleted. 
3. Compressing videos - to compress a video to desired output quality and resolution. 

### What's the future for Venlow

Since Android lacks a video compression app with quality output, we are planning to improve Venlow to be an all-in-one video compressor with editing options such as stickers, texts, custom crop, rotate, etc. We can't give an estimated time for this. But we'll definitely start working on it.

We will publish all the updates in this blog.
