### What Happened?

In one of the recent WhatsApp update (2.21.14.24), WhatsApp changed how video is shared and removed the ability to post high quality videos by users, which I think is a very bad move from WhatsApp since the default video quality is awful.

As a result, Venlow also had to reduce it's quality options and the videos won't be as good as it used to be. I know many of you use Venlow regularly to improve the quality of stories that you share on WhatsApp. It is very unfortunate that WhatsApp have made this decision. 

I am currently working on ways to improve the quality but I can't give a promise since it is on WhatsApp side that the quality is being lost.

### Can I still use Venlow to post WhatsApp statuses anymore?

Yes you can. If you're on an older version of WhatsApp, then you can post videos without losing quality as it used to be.

If you're on the recent versions of WhatsApp, **You have to update Venlow to the latest version** and choose a moderate quality to upload the video.

### What other uses does Venlow have?

Yes. You can keep using Venlow for putting statuses to WhatsApp as well as other things such as: 

1. Share it to other apps which require a compressed video for good output (eg: Telegram)
2. Save the videos for saving storage - A 100 MB video can be stored at 12 MB and original video can be deleted. Remember to uncheck the crop option
3. Compressing videos - to compress a video to desired output quality and resolution. 

Thanks once again.
